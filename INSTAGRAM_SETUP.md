# Instagram API Integration Setup

This guide will help you connect your actual Instagram account to load real posts in your portfolio.

## Current Implementation

The gallery now has an Instagram-like design with:
- ✅ Instagram-style square grid layout
- ✅ Profile header with gradient ring (Instagram style)
- ✅ Hover effects showing likes and Instagram icon
- ✅ Post statistics (likes, followers count)
- ✅ Enhanced UI matching Instagram aesthetics

## To Enable Real Instagram Posts

### Option 1: Instagram Basic Display API (Recommended)

1. **Create Facebook App**
   - Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com)
   - Create a new app
   - Add Instagram Basic Display product

2. **Configure Instagram Basic Display**
   - Set redirect URI to your domain
   - Add test users (your Instagram account)

3. **Get Access Token**
   - Complete OAuth flow to get user access token
   - Store token securely (localStorage or secure backend)

4. **Update Code**
   - The app already includes Instagram API integration
   - Add your access token to localStorage: `localStorage.setItem('instagram_access_token', 'YOUR_TOKEN')`

### Option 2: Instagram Embed API (Public Posts Only)

For public posts without authentication:
- Uses Instagram's oEmbed API
- Limited to individual post embeds
- No feed access

### Option 3: Third-Party Services

Consider services like:
- **Instafeed.js** - Client-side Instagram feed
- **Instagram Graph API** - For business accounts
- **Social media aggregators** - Paid services

## Current Features

- **Fallback Content**: Uses AI-generated realistic art posts
- **Instagram Aesthetics**: Square grid, hover effects, profile styling
- **Performance**: Optimized images and loading states
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices

## Testing

The app currently works with simulated Instagram-style content. When you click "Sync with Instagram", it generates realistic art posts that match your brand.

To test with real Instagram data:
1. Set up Instagram API (steps above)
2. Add access token to localStorage
3. Click "Sync with Instagram" button

## Security Notes

- Never commit access tokens to version control
- Use environment variables for production
- Consider token refresh mechanisms
- Implement proper error handling
