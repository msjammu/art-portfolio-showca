The design should evoke sophistication, timelessness, and artistic appreciation - feeling like a high-end gallery space translated to digital form. Minimal interface approach better serves the core purpose by allowing artwork to be the primary focus.

## Color Selection

Custom palette - A refined monochromatic scheme with subtle warm accents to complement artwork without competing.

- **Primary Color**: Deep charcoal (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Professional, timeless foundation that doesn't interfere with artwork colors
- **Secondary Colors**: Warm whites and soft grays (oklch(0.98 0 0), oklch(0.95 0 0)) - Clean backgrounds that make colors pop
- **Accent Color**: Warm gold (oklch(0.7 0.1 85)) - Subtle luxury accent for buttons and highlights, reminiscent of gallery frames

  - Background (Pure White oklch(1 0 0)): Charcoal text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey artistic sophistication and contemporary elegance - using a refined sans-serif for headings and a highly legible serif for body text to create hierarchy and readability.

  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Bold/24px/normal spacing

## Animations

Animations should enhance the gallery experience through subtle, purposeful motion that guides attention and creates smooth transitions without distracting from the artwork.
